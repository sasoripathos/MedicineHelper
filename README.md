# MedicineHelper

This project is derived from the project I contributed to in ArthritisHack 2017. The original repository used in hackthon is a private one, held by waynepud (Wayne).

This project for me is only for learning new tech skills. Feel free to play with and make your own project based on this one. 

Since in ArthritisHack 2017, the original project was designed to help people with Arthritis keep tracking their medication. This project will keep the theme. However, please keep in mind this project is only for fun and practicing. It is NOT a mature commercial product.
